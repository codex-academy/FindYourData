# Create a more interactive experience

To create a more interactive web application experience to users you can take control of page rendering and minimize page refreshes. Instead of refreshing a whole page, refreshing only certain fragments of a page results in better user experience.

To refresh only certain fragments of the page one uses AJAX, which is based upon the `XMLHttpRequest` object. This allows one to send HTTP requests, such as GET and POST, to the backend asynchronously. See more details about the `XMLHttpRequest` in [Chapter 17 of Eloquent Javascript: HTTP](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html#h_Gh3HVKEFJQ)

Read more about [using Ajax with jQuery](/steps/ajax.html) or see some alternatives on [You might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#ajax).
