# Create a more interactive experience

To create a more interactive web application experience to users you need to take control of page rendering and minimize page refreshes. Instead of refreshing a whole page, refreshing only certain fragments of a page results in better user experience.

To refresh only certain fragments of the page one uses AJAX, which is based upon the `XMLHttpRequest` object. This allows one to send HTTP requests, such as GET and POST, to the backend asynchronously. See more details about the XMLHttpRequest in [Chapter 17 of Eloquent Javascript: HTTP](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html)
