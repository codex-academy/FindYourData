# Find my data

## Search bar

Add a search bar to your products screen so that users can find products. They should type in the product name in a text field. When they press the search button only the products that match their search should be displayed.

## Interactive search bar

Let's add an interactive search bar to your Products screen.

The search bar should:

* start searching after you have typed 3 characters
* only display the products that match the search
* display matches for both Product and Category names
* display all products if the search bar is empty
